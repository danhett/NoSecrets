	Everything else released under the DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO public license.

	As a digital artist and creative technologist, Dan’s work and practice is
	governed entirely by openness and shared process - from the things he builds,
	the technology he uses to create things, and even the live use of his work on
	stage and beyond. In this session Dan will explain why he relies so heavily
	on a very open and rapid prototyping process, and why every stage of his
	creative process is shared. Dan's output is distributed under highly
	permissive, and even confrontational licenses - inviting anyone to take his
	work and quite literally ‘do what the f**k you want to’ with it, no credit
	or source required. Dan will also examine why this sort of transparency is
	something that should pervade every level of our technological progress and
	innovation, and why the most dangerous thing in the world is an entirely
	opaque system owned by someone else. And, most importantly, together we will
	question what this all means to us as digital creators and builders -
	do we keep helping to construct these dangerous black boxes, or should we
	be dismantling them?

					<h2>Dan Hett</h2>
					<h4>TECHNOLOGIST/ARTIST</h4>
					<aside class='notes'>
						I'm somewhere in between a creative programmer and digital artist. Put another way - I write code for a living, but I absolutely regard myself as a creative who happens to use software, rather than a software guy who stumbled into art and design.
					</aside>

					<h2>Dan Hett</h2>
					<h4>COMPUTER PUNK</h4>
					<aside class='notes'>
						But, more than anything, I try to be as punk as possible with computers. Hopefully this will make sense by the end of this!

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>NO SECRETS</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						This talk is about having some transparency, and being a little brave, in making and using your technology and your craft - and why it’s important. Firstly in terms of how I work, how I create things, and how/why I’ve gone from a corporate computer programmer with a career built on secrets, to a radical digital artist that shares my process, code, thoughts, trademarks, and everything else.
					</aside>
				</section>


				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>ME ...AND YOU.</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						But also, and I think more importantly, this is as much about me pointing at you guys and hopefully getting you to try and perhaps question the way in which you do things, both as a creative or programmer or whatver you may be, but also as a user and as a person.
					</aside>
				</section>


				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>HELLO, WORLD</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						So, although I’m a programmer, I snuck in through the back door - I didn’t study computer science, or maths. I in fact did Design & Visual Arts, and so on paper I’m technically more qualified to screw around with your branding than I am to build you an iPhone app.

						And I think this is probably one of the big reasons I'm doing all the stuff I do now - I didn't take a traditional route into any of this, and so I've never really accepted any of the traditional aspects of working with software or data. The idea that "well, this is how it's always been done" isn't really a thing when you're so late to the party, and actually that's been great!
					</aside>

					<p>CLASSICALLY TRAINED?</p>
					<aside class='notes'>Not that there’s anything wrong with studying computer science of course. I think of normal programmers being sort of the classically trained musicians...</aside>

					<p>CLASSIC, UNTRAINED</p>
					<aside class='notes'>...to my three chord punk. Same core tools, wildly different approaches. And of course we need both, I don't want this kind of programmer working for my bank, and I don't want the other kind making my videogames, right?</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src='assets/megaphone.jpg'</img>
					<aside class='notes'>...except the music analogy falls down a little bit because classically trained musicians don't go to punk shows and tell the band they're not playing their instruments properly, which has ABSOLUTELY been my experience - but that's OK.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src='assets/baby.jpg'</img>
					<aside class='notes'>Luckily, nowadays I actually exclusively subsist on the tears of crybaby neckbeards who tell me I'm doing all this incorrectly, or slightly inefficiently. What I did get from all this was a valuable lesson though - for the most part, you don’t NEED to be a classically trained programmer to get by. Obviously you need to learn, and there are good and bad ways to most things, but you don’t need to get dogmatic about most of this stuff AT ALL.  </aside>

						My first industry job was for a company mostly working within the pharmaceutical sector. At this point I wasn't really a proper developer yet, I was a sort of intereactive designer and fresh graduate.

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/storytime.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						At this point my worlds started collide a little, when I scored a gig working at BBC Children's in the UK. This was a HUGE scale job, creating apps for millions and millions of users. Very high intensity and high pressure. And also, the projects were HUGE in scale sometimes, which seems like a great thing on paper. There's a certain sort of romantic idea around pouring your heart and soul into a huge project for years - the cameraderie of the tough challenge, the late night pizzas, the intense process - all that stuff. But to be honest, I know some people thrive in that sort of scenario, but it wasn't for me.</aside>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/bafta1.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>I even won a BAFTA, and picked up a few nominations. I only ever saw the BAFTA once, but it exists...</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/bafta2.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>...but I didn't let it go to my head. So, while that was a cool place to work, it was a very nailed-down environment in terms of tech - which is understandable, you need solid stuff if it's going out to millions of users, and I had to really really have my shit together. But really, I'm not a very processey kind of guy - if I never see another JIRA ticket in my life I'll be a happy man.</aside>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/gamejam2.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>However. Through my interest in videogames, and my wobbly new skills as a coder, I started writing games, and interactive stuff under my own steam. One of things that grew from this was me starting the Manchester Game Jam. [JAM SPEIL HERE] </aside>

						...PROGRAMMING IS LITERALLY MAGIC.

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/rd1.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Finally I ended up getting a rare shot at a position for the BBC's prestigious Research and Development group, which I dived on. Now this is where things got interesting, because suddenly I was doing research, and not developing products. And what this meant was, for the first time I was working in a way where my PROCESS was open, transparent, and in many ways as important a component of the project as the outcome. And I find this way of working hugely exciting, for reasons I'll outline in a moment. </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/officespace.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						So, this sort of work really gave me the opportunity to work in places that weren't always neccesarily desks. This is defintely a theme in my career from this point onwards!
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/primer2.jpg'>
					<p>BBC R&D - PRIMER / 'NEARLY LIVE'</p>
					<aside class='notes'>Primer was a piece of research into creating a completely new workflow, that would allow the BBC to cover more events more cheaply - it used four massively high resolution and completely unmanned cameras to record a live event, and allowed a single operator to create and jump between virtual HD cameras defined from this huge wall of pixels. Really what this project did was create a whole new sort of craft role, between cameraman, director and editor, all in real time. </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/primer3.jpg'>
					<p>BBC R&D - PRIMER / 'NEARLY LIVE'</p>
					<aside class='notes'>The 'nearly live' aspect came in when the operator was able to stop time - you set yourself a buffer window between the event happening and being broadcast, which allows you time to make fine-tuned edits and do things like blanking swearing out etc - some things have to be really live-live (like a football match) but for something like say, a music festival, even a few minutes of time to make decisions results in a hugely improved transmission quality. And, this is unmanned cameras and a single operator, so the costs are massively reduced, allowing the BBC (or anyone) to cover more events. This whole front end system was built using browser tech, which was a fairly intense technical undertaking but resulted in something that actually didn't even need to happen on site - I edited a live transmission from the Edinburgh festival while sitting hundreds of miles away in my office in Manchester.</aside>

				<section>
					<img src='assets/quit.jpg'>
					<p>OMG</p>
					<aside class='notes'>I quit, set up as a freelancer. There are a million small reasons why (money, freedom, and a burning desire to pursue my art), but actually for today's purposes...</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/kit.jpg'>
					<p>"Here. Build this."</p>
					<aside class='notes'>...one of the main reasons for me making this move is, really, that I don't want to be at the end of the chain. Particularly as a developer there's this thing that happens where you get handed a fully-formed idea and are told 'here, build this'. And, the projects that I worked on that were rapid and open and brave and experimental - those were the ones that really worked for me creatively.
					I've always been fiercely independent, and so going freelance was really when I decided to put my money where my mouth is (literally).</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/chaos.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>And so, my career trajectory has followed this increasing desire to work in a more open and rapid way, and actually working on shorter and shorter projects has in many ways gone hand in hand with the ability to share my process and code openly (the bigger the project, the more likely it's for a corporate entity that want to play their cards close to their chest...). </aside>

					<h3>SHORT PROJECTS.</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>Specifically, and aside from what I just mentioned, there are two big reasons why short projects are wonderful...</aside>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/typography1.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>A gallery in my home city was about to close, and move to a new huge space - they came to me and asked if we could spend some time re-interpreting some of their materials into new forms. This included tons of architectural plans, data, and some amazing typography, which is what we focused on.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/typography2.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>We chose to not focus on the final pieces we designed, but actually tried to illustrate the process. Using a quick but brute-force algorithm, we created a process that would try, over hundreds of thousands of iterations, to reassemble a smal number of polygons into the finished form, as closely as possible. The code itself ended up being a THROWAWAY TOOL, and wasn't the product - the print was the product. This is important to me - as a programmer I'm often instinctively very protective over my code, my sources. But actually more often than not, it's fine to trash it once it's served it's purpose! </aside>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h1>THE WORD 'ALGORITHM'</h1>
						<aside class='notes'>Oh, and of course while we're talking about algorithms - I'm going to talk about algorithms a lot more during in this talk. I've heard it said that "algorithm" is a word that programmers use when they don't want to tell you what they did... </aside>

					<aside class='notes'>...and I also quite enjoy this insight from respected digital culture commentator Piers Morgan.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/scribbler1.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>Anyway. That tiny little project that took mere hours to do, really opened up conversation with the gallery - what it did was really illustrate clearly what you could do in very little time and money, just by being super clear about what you're trying to build, and not freaking out and wasting time worrying about the code too much! And so, they came to me and some colleagues in Studio Audience (who are in the house today!) to do something a bit bigger and a bit cooler!</aside>

						And so, what do I actually mean when I talk about “transparency” and “openness”? I guess this is important to clarify, given I'm about to scale all this up beyond just what I'm up to.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>TECHNICAL TRANSPARENCY</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						From a technical standpoint, this is easy - where possible, like so many others that I work alongside, I open source my work under highly permissive licenses. I utilise open source technologies and platforms. These very slides are written in Javascript, the images andd code distrubuted under a completely permissive license (more on that in a moment).

						Learning this stuff has never been more easy - and this has been driven enormously by the open sharing of ideas. It blows my mind, still, now, that anyone with any piece of garbage computer and an internet connection can learn almost anything. And, more excitingly still, this also means that anyone with a piece of garbage computer and an internet connection can SHARE everything too. And that's what makes this whole thing tick. It's what makes me tick.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>CREATIVE TRANSPARENCY</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						From a creative standpoint, I follow a very open process too. We are all products of our environment and our experiences and our fellow human beings - I don’t think you get the best results as a creative practitioner by locking yourself in a basement and working alone. I prototype often and early, put them in front of real people quickly, iterate publically, and share the process.

						And I think this one is perhaps harder to do. It's harder to shift your mindset than it is to shift where you stick your code. But, it can be done.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>THIS FEELS WRONG!</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						In many ways, all this seems counter-intuitive. Sharing what you make while you’re still making it? Giving your code away, that you worked so hard on? But it isn’t counter-intuitive. It does make sense. By working this in way, we enrich practice, we enrich our work, we enrich ourselves.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>WIN #1</h2>
					<h4>TEST QUICKLY, ON PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ME/COLLEAGUES</h4>
					<aside class='notes'>
						I get to test things I’ve made, but most importantly: on someone who isn’t me. This gives me wholly unexpected results, and steers the thing I’m making in a direction I never would have landed on.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>WIN #2</h2>
					<h4>FAIL FAST, GET FEEDBACK, ITERATE REPEATEDLY</h4>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Sharing a prototype I’ve built very early on, publically, and having it fail. I reach a conclusion that would have taken much longer (or potentially never being found) had I kept it to myself.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>WIN #3</h2>
					<h4>RELEASE THE SOURCE, WATCH THE MAGIC</h4>
					<aside class='notes'>
						I can release the source code for a project that I’ve deployed, and then another programmer, much more skilled than I (there are many!) forks the code, makes a swathe of improvements, and I pull them back into my stream of work. Everybody wins.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>FAIL BOLDLY</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						And so this brings me up to now: I’m a creative coder and digital artist, and I work completely openly in all respects - from my designs to my code to my data to my conclusions, even if the thing I’m working on fails. Oh and by the way, one of the other really nice side-effects of working quickly and transparently is that failure is a PERFECTLY acceptable endpoint. If you work quickly enough that it doesn't matter, failure becomes a learning experience. Or even a required step. And if you're working with others and sharing those mistakes? Failure becomes a jumping-off point for new directions, new voices, more input.
					</aside>

						<p>- "Code should be seen as well as heard, underlying algorithms viewed as well as their visual outcome"</p>
						<p>- "It is not necessary for a lay audience to understand the code to appreciate it, much as it is not necessary to know how to play guitar in order to appreciate watching a guitar performance."</p>

					<h2>THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME...</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						OK. So you’re getting the transparency thing. Great. But, this isn’t about me, is it? This is about you too! This is about us as a community of creators - designers, builders, makers, experimenters. This is about us as consumers, and users, and human beings.

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h2>...IT'S ABOUT YOU</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						But it starts with you. And doing it is easy. Open source that side project. Publish your prototypes, your research. Engage with others. And not just when you succeed! The only thing you do by keeping this stuff to yourself is limit the potential for good in your work.

					<h2>DEFAULT TO TRANSPARENCY</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						In other words - transparency can and should be your default operating mode. And what happens is, that you start to reap all the benefits that I outlined today as a single person. But then, it grows: transparency cultivates a positive culture shift for teams, technologies, companies, whatever.

					<h2>BE BRAVE</h2>
					<aside class='notes'>
						You just have to be brave. Being transparent with your work, your mistakes, your path - it is brave.

						Doing anything (building software for example) a certain way should never ever be justified by saying “that’s how we’ve always done it”. Ever.

						Transparency and open process requires a shift in thinking, completely.

						And so, what I think is happening - almost imperceptibly at first, but now very rapidly - is that I think we’re seeing a shift in the ownership and steerage of our technology. We're developing an awareness as consumers and owners of technology. Like, my parents now comment on this stuff in at least a slightly informed way, and that can only be good, right?

						We’ve got a long way to go, but I feel like it’s happening. We’re starting to understand, as a community of users and people, that giant opaque entities owning our data and driving our experiences is ultimately a really bad thing.
						And we, right here, are the designers and gatekeepers of the systems that are powering this shift.

					<h2>SMART THINGS<br />BRIGHT FUTURE?</h2>

						The rough theme of this evening has been the provocation "Smart things, bright future?" - and I do think the future is bright...

					<h2>YES.</h2>
					<p>BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY</p>
					<aside class='notes'>
						....but really, none of this is about technology. Tech is the enabler, but the real innovation isn’t inventing new gadgets. Mastodon isn't built on anything new or particularly cutting edge, but what it IS built on is a policy of transparency and community accountability - taking these systems out of the hands of companies and into the hands of quite literally everybody. Changing the way we talk about and use technology is a human thing, not a technological one.

					<h2>WE ARE THE START</h2>

						But all of this, starts with us. And you can do it right now, even if it’s just tiny steps you make as a single person, that effect change on a much grander scale further down the line.
