				<section>
					<img src='assets/megaphone.jpg'>

					<!-- <aside class='notes'>Luckily, nowadays I actually exclusively subsist on the tears of crybaby neckbeards who tell me I'm doing all this incorrectly, or slightly inefficiently. What I did get from all this was a valuable lesson though - for the most part, you don’t NEED to be a classically trained programmer to get by. Obviously you need to learn, and there are good and bad ways to most things, but you don’t need to get dogmatic about most of this stuff AT ALL. </aside> -->

					<p>BULLSHIT WORLD CHAMP 2008</p>
					<aside class='notes'>
						<p>- problem with being late to the party is that I had to effectively lie to get my first gig</p>
						<p>- everything went fine, my advice is always to say yes!</p>
						<p>- all you really need is a can-do attitude, Google, and persistence. Persistence is almost everything! (NOT ON COMPANY TIME)</p>
					</aside>
					<!-- <aside class='notes'>My first gig in the industry was a local agency, and let's be real here: I effectively bullshitted my way into a deveopment job. The big lesson here is that within reason, you should always say YES when an opportunity for money and/or excitement pops up. (of course this doesn't apply if you're on a plane and someone shouts "oh my god is there a doctor on the plane"), but for something as easy as writing a bit of code, yeah definitely! Fuck being classically trained! Google and a 'can do' attitude will get you 80% of the way, and the rest is dogged persistence and a willingness to fail (ideally when not on company time - I've done both)</aside> -->

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/storytime.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>From there I went to work for BBC Children's in the UK. This was a huge scale job, creating apps for millions and millions of users. Very high intensity and high pressure. And also, the projects were HUGE in scale sometimes, which seems like a great thing on paper. There's a certain sort of romantic idea around pouring your heart and soul into a huge project for years - the cameraderie of the tough challenge, the late night pizzas, the intense process - all that stuff. But to be honest, I know some people thrive in that sort of scenario, but it wasn't for me.</aside>

					<aside class='notes'>I even won a BAFTA, and picked up a few nominations. I only ever saw the BAFTA once, but it exists...</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/bafta2.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>...but I didn't let it go to my head. So, while that was a cool place to work, it was a very nailed-down environment in terms of tech - which is understandable, you need solid stuff if it's going out to millions of users, and I had to really really have my shit together. But really, I'm not a very processey kind of guy - if I never see another JIRA ticket in my life I'll be a happy man.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/rd1.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>Finally I ended up getting a rare shot at a position for the BBC's prestigious Research and Development group, which I dived on. Now this is where things got interesting, because suddenly my colleagues were a mix of discliplines, skills and attitudes - far fewer classically trained programmers and a FAR MORE RENEGADES </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/desk.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>Suddenly I wasn't stuck at a desk, I was writing code in a TV studio, or at a festival! I was building things that weren't being stuck on the app store, or even facing users, but were instead just there to understand and test a problem out quickly and boldly. And this is the kind of thing I mean when I talk about not being comfortable. None of this was well-trodden tech, and none of the problems we were working on there were even remotely solved - and that's quite scary, but super fucking exciting. Part of striding forward is using the tools and languages you know well, in entirely unexpected ways.</aside>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/primer2.jpg'>
					<p>BBC R&D - PRIMER / 'NEARLY LIVE'</p>
					<aside class='notes'>Primer was a piece of research into creating a completely new workflow, that would allow the BBC to cover more events more cheaply - it used four massively high resolution and completely unmanned cameras to record a live event, and allowed a single operator to create and jump between virtual HD cameras defined from this huge wall of pixels. Really what this project did was create a whole new sort of craft role, between cameraman, director and editor, all in real time. </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/primer3.jpg'>
					<p>BBC R&D - PRIMER / 'NEARLY LIVE'</p>
					<!-- <aside class='notes'>The 'nearly live' aspect came in when the operator was able to stop time - you set yourself a buffer window between the event happening and being broadcast, which allows you time to make fine-tuned edits and do things like blanking swearing out etc - some things have to be really live-live (like a football match) but for something like say, a music festival, even a few minutes of time to make decisions results in a hugely improved transmission quality. And, this is unmanned cameras and a single operator, so the costs are massively reduced, allowing the BBC (or anyone) to cover more events. This whole front end system was built using browser tech, which was a fairly intense technical undertaking but resulted in something that actually didn't even need to happen on site - I edited a live transmission from the Edinburgh festival while sitting hundreds of miles away in my office in Manchester.</aside> -->

					<p>BBC R&D - COOK-ALONG KITCHEN EXPERIENCE (CAKE!)</p>

				<section>
					<img src='assets/quit.jpg'>
					<p>OMG</p>
					<aside class='notes'>I quit, set up as a freelancer. There are a million small reasons why (money, freedom, and a burning desire to pursue my art), but actually for today's purposes...</aside>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/kit.jpg'>
					<p>"Here. Build this."</p>
					<aside class='notes'>...one of the main reasons for me making this move is, really, that I don't want to be at the end of the chain. Particularly as a developer there's this thing that happens where you get handed a fully-formed idea and are told 'here, build this'. And that, my friends, is comfortable. And if that's what you want to do, then that's totally cool, but for me this doesn't feel right. And to be fair, this was significantly less acute in BBC R&D, where we had a lot of agency to explore problems together and then solve them technically, we were still operating within research areas that someone else had defined - questions somebody else had asked. And so, I quit, and now I get to ask my own questions.</aside>

					<h3>SIDE PROJECTS -> PROJECTS</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>And of course, like I'm sure many of you in this room, I almost always have a bunch of side projects on the go. My wife calls mine a 'crippling addiction' to side projects, which I think is a bit unfair, but - what's happened now is that some of my 'side projects' have turned into just straight-up work projects now, which is a really good thing. And I couldn't have done that without taking the leap out of full time employment and into the void!</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h3>WHY SHORT PROJECTS?</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>So my trajectory career-wise was that my projects started to get shorter and more intense as time went on, and I really liked this. Short projects (both side projects and for money) really suit me well - I have the attention span of a three year old, and I get bored really easily. And again, really that should make me an awful programmer, right? WRONG! There are two specific reasons why short achieveable projects are amazing:</aside>

					<img class='stretch' src='assets/gamejam1.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>Outside of work, I started getting a taste for really all-out rapid projects very early on, starting with things like creating one of the UK's biggest game jams. Now a game jam for those uninitiated is sort of a hackday for games, where you'll design and build and test a fun playable videogame in a few short days, or even hours! </aside>

					<h3>EVOLVING > CREATING</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>One thing I did also want to get across is, while of course one of the things I most enjoy is taking technologies and using them for unintended purposes, I actually have better results when I don't start from scratch every time. In fact, I think one of my core acts as a creative nowadays is holding up a project or whatever, staring at it really hard, and asking myself: where can I take this now? Its very rare I truly draw a line under anything. For example: </aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/typography1.png'>
					<aside class='notes'>A gallery in my home city was about to close, and move to a new huge space - they came to me and asked if we could spend some time re-interpreting some of their materials into new forms. This included tons of architectural plans, data, and some amazing typography, which is what we focused on.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/typography2.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>We chose to not focus on the final pieces we designed, but actually tried to illustrate the process. Using a quick but brute-force algorithm, we created a process that would try, over hundreds of thousands of iterations, to reassemble a smal number of polygons into the finished form, as closely as possible. The code itself ended up being a THROWAWAY TOOL, and wasn't the product - the print was the product. This is important to me - as a programmer I'm often instinctively very protective over my code, my sources. But actually more often than not, it's fine to trash it once it's served it's purpose! </aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h1>THE WORD 'ALGORITHM'</h1>
						<aside class='notes'>Oh, and of course while we're talking about algorithms - I'm going to talk about algorithms a lot more during in this talk. I've heard it said that "algorithm" is a word that programmers use when they don't want to tell you what they did... </aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<img class='stretch' src='assets/scribbler1.jpg'>
					<aside class='notes'>Anyway. That tiny little project that took mere hours to do, really opened up conversation with the gallery - what it did was really illustrate clearly what you could do in very little time and money, just by being super clear about what you're trying to build, and not freaking out and wasting time worrying about the code too much! And so, they came to me and some colleagues in Studio Audience (who are in the house today!) to do something a bit bigger and a bit cooler!</aside>

					<h3>DO IT WRONG</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>Aside from trying to sometimes operate at very high speed, one of the other ways in which I like to try and break out of my comfortable safe zone is to really try and contort, break, and genererally mis-use my tools and languages. Knowing something inside-out is sometimes exactly what you need, but often when I'm in a rut creatively, one of my strongest weapons is to reassess and remix and challenge what I've built before, or what I'm using. For example:</aside>

					<h3>BREAK YOUR STUFF</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>Taking tools and languages designed for one thing, and mis-shaping them into stupid new forms, is my jam. And I highly recommend this as a way of generating new ideas, approaches - ask yourself: how I can take this thing and contort the shit out of it until it does something else?

					<h3>IN SHORT:</h3>

					<h3>DON'T GET COMFORTABLE</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>Being comfortable and complacent is your absolute number one enemy as a creative. And you gotta fight it! If you have even the faintest desire to grow as a practitioner you have to slay that compulsion to just put your feet up (literally or metaphorically).</aside>

					<h3>DESTROY, REBUILD, DESTROY AGAIN</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>The old line about 'rules are made to be broken' isn't enough - both the rules, and the tools you have at your disposal (be that software, technique, or mindset), can and should be destroyed, dismantled, reconfigured and rebuilt constantly. THE ONLY RULES ARE THE ONES WE ENFORCE ON OURSELVES </aside>

				<section data-background-image="">
					<h3>STAY PUNK</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>And I think this whole mindset should permeate every part of the process, it's not just about smashing up code and breaking your tools. We're all creatives here: you can and should be as bold and defiant and sure as you can be in your ideas, in the way you approach a problem, the way in which you work. You're a creative, you have unlimited opportunity to do as much amazing interesting beautiful work as you can - so be punk. At least in spirit. Don't waste it being Coldplay. You don't want to be Coldplay, do you?</aside>

					<h3>A MILLION RIGHT WAYS</h3>
					<aside class='notes'>Do not listen to your inner worrier, the book author, or ANY fucking neckbeard on the internet: there are plenty of ways to do something wrong of course, but the real secret is that there's a million ways to do something right. If it feels right, looks right, and does the job - you're doing it right. (again, if you get a job writing code for a bank, or NASA, then at that point you should stop accepting freewheeling career advice from a hungover guy on a stage in Amsterdam)</aside>

						In 1960, the New York Giants American football team hired a kicker from Hungary. This is back when, if you watch old black and white NFL footage, they used to kick field goals really stupid and stiff, like a kid with rickets. And that was the norm, until they finally hired this soccer player from Hungary, and he came over and sees all these people - it had to be a lot of pressure, you sail all the way on a boat from Hungary to be a kicker, everyone else is kicking like an idiot! He says - "Well, I don't WANNA have to kick like an idiot just because that's how it's done". So finally, he says "Fuck em, I'm gonna kick like I kick". And he's the first guy to kick how they now kick field goals, soccer style. He didn't know he was a genius, he just said "I don't wanna look like an asshole, so I'm gonna muster up the courage to kick like I kick despite the peer pressure". He revolutionised every team in the NFL just by being brave, a little tiny bit. So whatever it is, if you think you have a brilliant idea, don't be afraid to be wrong... </aside>
