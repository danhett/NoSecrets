# FITC Amsterdam 2017

![FITC Logo](/assets/cover.png)

This repo contains the slides, assets and speaker notes for my FITC Amsterdam 2017 presentation, "Don't Get Comfortable". http://fitc.ca/presentation/dont-get-comfortable/

PLAY ALONG AT HOME: https://danhett.github.io/FITCtalk/

I decided to distribute my content like this for a few reasons.
- Firstly, Keynote doesn't work everywhere. This format is a nice safety net.
- Secondly, I constantly say I'm going to send out resources and things, and forget every time. This way, links and additional thoughts are stored with the talk, so anyone can go back through it and get more info.
- Third, I like the idea of using open source technologies to power the talk. It's slightly more clunky than an easy Keynote pres, but the whole thing is stored in Github and works anywhere on any platform, and this is a huge huge plus for me.

index.html is the core of the whole thing, `<aside>` nodes contain extended speaker notes.

Links to things mentioned in this talk, in no particular order!
